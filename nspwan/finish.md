Compared to Docker, systemd-nspawn is still only a toy for a few, but it is well established. Compared to Docker, systemd-nspawn can run multiple program threads simultaneously within a single container without interfering with each other. Compared to a real virtual machine, systemd-nspawn is lighter, requires fewer resources and places less of a burden on the host system.

This technology is well worth learning about, and you may want to try this out one day when you are unhappy with the limitations of Docker.
